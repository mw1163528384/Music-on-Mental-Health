# Music on Mental Health
 
This is the repository for Music on Mental Health. The goal for this project is to explore how different music genres and listening habits can affect a person suffering from various mental health issues from the dataset. Based on the userâ€™s mental issues, and demographics, train and test a model that informs the user if their favourite music genre is improving their mental health issues. The dataset is obtained through Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results
